Included are 5 things:

 - 3 simple datasheets for the 3 varieties of the sensors; GP2Y0E02A is for the analog version, GP2Y0E02B is for the i2c version, and GP2Y0E03 is for the version that has both interfaces.

 - The last PDF (GP2Y0E02_03_appl_e) is the more detailed programming and timing guide for all the sensors.

 - An Arduino Program to burn new i2c addresses into the GP2Y0E03 and GP2Y0E02B.
   The code should have enough comments that you can just use it, but you should still read the section on setting i2c addresses and burning E-Fuses in the GP2Y0E02_03_appl_e PDF before using it.
